As this is in brainstorming phase we currently keep this in the wiki:

https://github.com/magento-hackathon/Tracker/wiki/Feature-collection


Installation
-----

* Install composer
* Clone the git repository
* As a developer: Call `composer.phar install --prefer-source`. This allows you to easier contribute to the upstream git repositories. (especially oro-platform)
* If you are not a developer: You do not need the --prefer-source option


User Interface
-----

Currently in Brainstorming: https://github.com/magento-hackathon/Tracker/wiki/User-interface


Ideas and Thoughts
------------------

  - What about mobile: Apps over API like redmine or responsive from scratch?
  - see Features Collection, as we are still Brain-Storming
